We detected some columns that are not present in your databaseâ€™s CDC instance.
We cannot sync the following columns until they are present in the CDC instance:

| schema | table | columns |
| ------ | ----- | --------- |
#foreach ($warning in $warnings)
| $warning.schema | $warning.table | $warning.columns |
#end

To include these columns, disable your current CDC instance and create a new one.
Creating a new CDC instance will automatically schedule a re-sync of the table.

Steps to disable current CDC instance:

1. Select capture instance (i.e. column `capture_instance`) name for schema and table for the role name (i.e. example user) provided:
```
EXEC sys.sp_cdc_help_change_data_capture @source_schema = '<schema>', @source_name = 'test_table';
```

2. Query to disable current CDC instance:
```
    EXEC sys.sp_cdc_disable_table
    @source_schema = [<schema>],
    @source_name   = [<table>],
    @capture_instance   = [<capture_instance>];
```

Query to create a new CDC instance:
```
    EXEC sys.sp_cdc_enable_table
    @source_schema = [<schema>],
    @source_name   = [<table>],
    @role_name     = [<role>];
```
